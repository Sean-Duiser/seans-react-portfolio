## Technology
This application uses React to piece together multiple componentents, utilities, and assets to create an intuitive and elegant portfolio page. Bootstrap was ued to perform certain CSS tasks, while React styling was used for the rest.

## Future Development
The contact page has a form that currently does not go anywhere. The next step in development will be to activate this form so any entries are sent to my email address.
