## Description

Looking For Good Grades was created as an an easy-to-use portal for users to get together and arrange study groups related to different programming languages. It uses an API-style configuration in order to allow a user to create and login to an account. Once a user is logged in they can navigate the site in order to post a study session or view other members session details. Along with creating a session, a commenting system exists in order to post specific comments regarding a particular session. These comment posts can also be modified or deleted. Specific elements such as meetup location along with study dates and times can all be addressed through LFGG.
